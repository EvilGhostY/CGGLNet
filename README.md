# CGGLNet
CGGLNet: Semantic Segmentation Network for  Remote Sensing Images Based on Category-Guided  Global-Local Feature Interaction


Our training framework follows UNetFormer(https://github.com/WangLibo1995/GeoSeg), and only needs to be run by adding config, losseses, and models to its framework.


The relevant code is being organized and will be posted as soon as possible.

If you don't want to retrain, we will also upload the data from the dataset in the following, as well as the weights of the relevant networks for direct testing.

After finishing, we will release the Baidu cloud URL.（）
