CGGLNet: Semantic Segmentation Network for  Remote Sensing Images Based on Category-Guided  Global-Local Feature Interaction


Our training and testing framework follows UNetFormer (https://github.com/WangLibo1995/GeoSeg), which is a well-established framework, thanks to the author LiBo Wang for sharing it.


Simply add config, losseses and models to its framework and it is ready to run.


The relevant code is being organized and will be posted as soon as possible.

If you don't want to retrain, we will also upload the data from the dataset in the following, as well as the weights of the relevant networks for direct testing.

After finishing, we will release the Baidu cloud URL.（）
